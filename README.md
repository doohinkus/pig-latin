# _ES6 Pig Latin_

#### _Vanilla JS/ES6 implementation (transpiled with Babel) of simple Pig Latin app. Why? Because I want to learn some new ES6 syntax and how better to work with Webpack. I also want to get closer to JS and CSS, so I actively avoided JQuery and Bootstrap. Will soon add responsive design and Twitter Api features. This, however, is a minimal viable product._
